                <h1>Proposal</h1>
                <h2>100 Thieves is a content creation and lifestyle centered eSports team dedicated to creating fresh merchandise and fun content for its fans/veiwers. The goal is to create
                    a new website for them that personifies that message and attitude.

                <p>The reason I chose the 100 Thieves Website is due to its simplicity and relatively easy to navigate nature. I would probably alter the 
                    navigation bar that they use to make more use of it instead of putting stuff all in the footer likey they did with their teams and partners.
                    I do like the simple color scheme but would maybe use more of the color scheme and make the site pop just a little bit more. I also like the animated
                    display they implemented on their main page.

                <h1>Content</h1>
                <p>For this project I aiming at having 3 to 4 pages. The pages would be the main page where you would see a navigation bar with links to the 
                    merchandise page, teams page, and content creators page. The merchandise page would allow the user to look at the various tshirts, hoodies, etc. available 
                    from 100thieves. The teams page woudl represent the various teams that fall under the umbrella of 100 thieves such as, LOL Teams, Valorant teams, and Call of 
                    Duty teams, etc. Finally I would have a Content creators pages where people who dont fall under the scope of professional teams would be listed and viewable. On the content 
                    creators page we would also see recent activity like tweets, posts, and even recently uploaded youtube or twitch vods.
                </p>

                <h1>Audience</h1>
                <p>
                    The audience of 100 Thieves is generally younger and mostly male. The audience may not be too heavily involved with eSports and 
                    generally are watching the content creators just hanging out and having a good time. When they use this site they will probablyt be looking
                    for the merhcnadise or updates on their favorite streamer or favorite eSports team. So giving them the ability to view the merchandise, posts,
                    and uploads of their favorite streamer/creator is top of the list.
